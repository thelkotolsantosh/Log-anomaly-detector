Log Anomaly Detector
This project demonstrates a simple approach to detecting abnormal response times
in server access logs.

The goal is not advanced machine learning, but clarity and correctness.

How it works:
- Load structured access logs
- Calculate average and deviation
- Flag unusually slow responses

Use cases:
- SOC triage
- Performance monitoring
- Learning baseline anomaly detection

Run:
python src/main.py
